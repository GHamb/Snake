Game Rules:
-The snake starts at the center of the board, moving north (upward).
-The snake moves at a constant speed.
-The snake moves only north, south, east, or west.
-The snake "moves" by adding a square to its head and simultaneously deleting a square from the tip of its tail.
-"Food" appear at random locations, and persist for a random amount of time.
-There is always exactly one apple visible at any given time.
-When the snake "eats" food, it gets longer.
-When the snake gets longer, say by n squares, it does so by not deleting squares from its tail for the next n moves.
-The game continues until the snake "dies".
-A snake dies by either (1) running into the edge of the board, or (2) by running into its own tail.
-The final score is based on the number of apples eaten by the snake.
